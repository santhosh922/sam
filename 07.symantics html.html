    <h3>Chandrayaan-3

    </h3>
    <p>
        Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and the lander touched down near the lunar south pole[8] on 23 August at 18:03 IST (12:33 UTC), making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and the first to do so near the lunar south pole.[9][note 1] On 3 September the lander hopped and repositioned itself 30–40 cm (12–16 in) from its landing site making the second hop on lunar surface after Surveyor 6.[13][14] After the completion of its mission objectives, it was hoped that the lander and rover would revive for extra tasks, on 22 September 2023, but missed the wake-up call. On September 30, the second lunar night began, eliminating hopes of revival.[15][16] On the other hand, Propulsion module returned to Earth's orbit on 22 November 2023 after exiting lunar orbit via a series of maneuvers starting from 9 October 2023.[17]

        Mission profile
    </h3>
    <p>
        Chandrayaan-3 was launched aboard an LVM3-M4 rocket on 14 July 2023, at 09:05 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India, entering an Earth parking orbit with a perigee of 170 km (106 mi) and an apogee of 36,500 km (22,680 mi). On 15 November 2023, the Cryogenic Upper Stage (C25) of the rocket (NORAD ID: 57321) made an uncontrolled re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere around 9:12 UTC. The impact point is predicted over the North Pacific Ocean and the final ground track did not pass over India.[42] [43][44]

Orbit
After a series of Earth bound manoeuvres that placed Chandrayaan-3 in a trans-lunar injection orbit,[45][46][47] ISRO performed a lunar-orbit insertion (LOI) on 5 August, successfully placing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into an orbit around the Moon. The LOI operation was carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru.[48][49]

On 17 August, the Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module to begin landing operations.[50]
